This RMarkdown notebook serves as the official documentation of the steps undertaken to 
produce the data and graphics that will show up on the PAA 2022 paper.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# R Packages

Basic packages were used to connect to databases (`DBI` and `RPostgres`), configure the 
complex survey schema (`survey`) and manipulate the data frames (`tidyverse`).

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(survey)
library(RPostgres)
```

# Connection to database

One of the containers hosts the `Postgres 14.0` database where all the data from
Census and National Health Survey lie.

```{r db}
# Connect to database 'pns'
conn <- dbConnect(
  RPostgres::Postgres(),
  dbname = Sys.getenv("PG_DB"),
  host = Sys.getenv("PG_HOST"),
  port = Sys.getenv("PG_PORT"),
  user = Sys.getenv("PG_USER"),
  password = Sys.getenv("PG_PASSWORD")
)
```

## Queries

The following two SQL-queries were used to retrieve only the necessary data from each table.

### Life table functions from Census

From all functions of the life table produced at the 2010th edition of the
Brazilian Population Census, only the functions $l_x$, $_nL_x$ and $e_x$ 
are needed for this paper.

  ) 
```

# Complex Survey Design

The National Health Survey (PNS) is a complex survey consisting of strata, 
cluster and weights.

The same steps were followed in order to set up the survey design object and
post-stratify it as listed in the official R package `PNSIBGE` (version 0.1.7).

```{r pns_survey_design, include=TRUE}
## Survey design (source: https://rdrr.io/cran/PNSIBGE/src/R/pns_design.R, accessed on September, 2nd 2022)
options(survey.lonely.psu="adjust")
options(survey.adjust.domain.lonely=TRUE)

pns2019_prior <- survey::svydesign(
  ids = ~upa_pns, 
  strata = ~v0024, 
  data = subset(pns2019_qry, !is.na(v0028)), 
  weights = ~v0028, 
  nest = TRUE
)
# Post-stratification
popc.types <- data.frame( 
  v00283=as.character(unique(pns2019_qry$v00283)), 
  Freq=as.numeric(unique(pns2019_qry$v00282))
)
popc.types <- popc.types[order(popc.types$v00283),]
pns2019_posterior <- survey::postStratify(
  design=pns2019_prior, 
  strata=~v00283, 
  population=popc.types
)
```

## Validation

Despite using exactly the same complex survey design, a full match with the 
government official statistics was not entirely possible.

![PNS2019 - Validation with self-reported health perception](./pns_validation.png){width=70% }

```{r pns_validation, include=TRUE}
# validation against
#   https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/tabela/7666#/n1/all/v/2667/p/all/c2/all/c12258/all/d/v2667%200/l/v,p+c2,t+c12258/resultado
round( svytable(formula=~j001+c006, design=subset(pns2019_posterior, c008 >=18))/1e3, 0)
```

```{r pns_validation_1, include=TRUE}
round( svytable(formula=~c006, design=subset(pns2019_posterior, c008 >= 18))/1e3, 0)
```


```{r pns_validation_2, include=TRUE}
round( sum(svytable(formula=~c006, design=subset(pns2019_posterior, c008 >= 18)))/1e3, 0)
```

*Conclusion:* although overall total and totals by gender are OK, among health perception the numbers do not match. Unfortunately it was not possible to reconcile the differences
but as the total figures are the same, we proceed with the analysis.

# PAA paper related analyses
